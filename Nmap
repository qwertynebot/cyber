# Nmap (Network Mapper)  

Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open-source tool for network analysis and port scanning. It allows users to identify active devices and services within a network, detect open ports, determine service versions, and uncover potential security threats.  

## Key Features  

### **Port Scanning**  
Nmap helps identify which ports are open or closed on a target system.  
```bash
nmap target.com
```  

### **Service Version Detection**  
Nmap can identify the versions of services running on open ports.  
```bash
nmap -sV target.com
```  

### **OS Detection**  
It attempts to determine the operating system of a target host.  
```bash
nmap -O target.com
```  

### **Scriptable Scanning**  
Nmap supports scripts to extend its functionality and detect specific vulnerabilities.  
```bash
nmap --script script_name target.com
```  

## **Additional Options**  

### **Aggressive Scan**  
Performs a more detailed and intensive scan.  
```bash
nmap -A target.com
```  

### **UDP Scanning**  
Detects open UDP ports.  
```bash
nmap -sU target.com
```  

### **Ping Scan**  
Identifies active hosts without scanning ports.  
```bash
nmap -sn target.com
```  

## **Advanced Usage**  

### **Scanning Multiple Targets**  
Nmap allows scanning multiple hosts at once:  
```bash
nmap 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3  
nmap 192.168.1.1-100  
nmap 192.168.1.*  
```  

### **Evading Firewalls & IDS**  
Some techniques help bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems:  
```bash
nmap -f target.com  # Fragment packets  
nmap --data-length 50 target.com  # Add random payloads  
nmap --mtu 32 target.com  # Use a custom MTU  
```  

### **Saving Scan Results**  
You can save scan results in different formats for further analysis:  
```bash
nmap -oN output.txt target.com  # Normal format  
nmap -oX output.xml target.com  # XML format  
nmap -oG output.gnmap target.com  # Grepable format  
```  

## **Example Usage**  

```bash
# Basic port scan
nmap target.com  

# Detect service versions
nmap -sV target.com  

# Detect the operating system
nmap -O target.com  

# Run a script-based scan
nmap --script script_name target.com  

# Aggressive scanning
nmap -A target.com  
```  

## **Legal and Ethical Considerations**  

Using Nmap to scan networks without proper authorization may violate laws and regulations. Always ensure you have permission before scanning any system.  

Additionally, some websites and servers may block or react to scanning attempts, so always use Nmap responsibly and follow ethical guidelines.
